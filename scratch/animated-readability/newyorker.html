                                <p class="descender">Nuno Miranda has been parking cars for
                                thirteen years, most of them in a lot just below Belém National
                                Palace, the eighteenth-century estate that serves as the official
                                residence of the President of Portugal. Miranda, who is
                                thirty-seven, is a lanky, amiable man, dressed in the style of
                                hipsters the world over: a few layers of untucked shirts and skinny
                                black jeans tucked into well-worn work boots. His dishevelled hair
                                falls just below his collar, and by 11
                                <!--<small>-->A.M.<!--</small>--> one day
                                recently the sun was bouncing off the thin gold chain around his
                                neck.</p>

                                <p>Miranda’s “job,” like that of the now-banished squeegee men of
                                New York, falls into the poorly defined space between labor and
                                harassment. Nobody is required to pay Miranda, but he rarely earns
                                less than fifty euros a day—a passable sum in one of Europe’s
                                poorest countries. There is no fighting for turf, nor have the
                                police ever tried to shoo him away. “I serve a purpose,” Miranda
                                told me, waving a metallic-blue Volkswagen Passat into an open
                                slot. “But I know I am lucky. I could have died long ago.”</p>

                                <p>Miranda is a heroin addict. Fifteen years ago, overwhelmed by
                                depression and anxiety about the future, he turned to drugs.
                                “Everyone did it then,” he said. “It was something I had to try. It
                                made my life bearable—it still does. Though it can ruin people,
                                too. I have seen that. When we started, we had no idea of the
                                consequences.”</p>

                                <p>By the nineteen-eighties, drug abuse had become a serious
                                problem in Portugal. The Lisbon government responded in the usual
                                way—increasing sentences for convictions and spending more money on
                                investigations and prosecutions. Matters only grew worse. In 1999,
                                nearly one per cent of the population—a hundred thousand
                                people—were heroin addicts, and Portugal reported the highest rate
                                of drug-related <small>AIDS</small> deaths in the European
                                Union.</p>

                                <p>In 2001, Portuguese leaders, flailing about and desperate for
                                change, took an unlikely gamble: they passed a law that made
                                Portugal the first country to fully decriminalize personal drug
                                use. (Other nations, such as Italy and the Netherlands, rarely
                                prosecute minor drug offenses, but none have laws that so
                                explicitly declare drugs to be “decriminalized.”) “We were out of
                                options,” João Goulão told me. Goulão is the president of the
                                Institute on Drugs and Drug Addiction, a department of the Ministry
                                of Health that oversees Portuguese drug laws and policy. “We were
                                spending millions and getting nowhere.” For people caught with no
                                more than a ten-day supply of marijuana, heroin, ecstasy, cocaine,
                                or crystal methamphetamine—anything, really—there would be no
                                arrests, no prosecutions, no prison sentences. Dealers are still
                                sent to prison, or fined, or both, but, for the past decade,
                                Portugal has treated drug abuse solely as a public-health
                                issue.</p>

                                <p>That doesn’t mean drugs are legal in Portugal. When caught,
                                people are summoned before an administrative body called the
                                Commission for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction. Each panel
                                consists of three members—usually a lawyer or a judge, a doctor,
                                and a psychologist or a social worker. The commissioners have three
                                options: recommend treatment, levy a small fine, or do nothing.
                                Counselling is the most common approach, and that is what Nuno
                                Miranda received when he appeared, in 2002, before the commission
                                in Lisbon. “I was using drugs for five or seven years before that
                                law passed,” he said. “Since then, everything has changed.
                                Everything.”</p>

                                <p>In most respects, the law seems to have worked: serious drug use
                                is down significantly, particularly among young people; the burden
                                on the criminal-justice system has eased; the number of people
                                seeking treatment has grown; and the rates of drug-related deaths
                                and cases of infectious diseases have fallen. Initial fears that
                                Portugal would become a haven for “drug tourism” have proved
                                groundless. Surprisingly, political opposition has been tepid and
                                there has never been a concerted repeal effort.</p>

                                <p>Yet there is much to debate about the Portuguese approach to
                                drug addiction. Does it help people to quit, or does it transform
                                them into more docile drug addicts, wards of an indulgent state,
                                with little genuine incentive to alter their behavior? By removing
                                the fear of prosecution, does the government actually encourage
                                addicts to seek treatment? Unfortunately, nothing about substance
                                abuse is simple. For instance, although many people maintain that
                                addiction would decline if drugs were legal in the United States,
                                the misuse of legally sold prescription medications has become a
                                bigger health problem than the sale of narcotics or cocaine. There
                                are questions not only about the best way to address addiction but
                                also about how far any society should go, morally, philosophically,
                                and economically, to placate drug addicts.</p>

                                <p>For Miranda, however, and for thousands of others who find
                                themselves participating in civil life rather than disrupting it,
                                such questions don’t matter. He has a wife and a sixteen-year-old
                                son, and adores them both. “My wife would never let me use heroin
                                at home,” he said. “I am not even allowed to smoke cigarettes in
                                the house.” With a stable family, a regular dealer, and his spot in
                                the parking lot, Miranda’s life has become orderly, almost routine.
                                “This is because of the law,” he said. “We are not hunted or scared
                                or looked upon as criminals,” he added, referring to the country’s
                                addicts. “And that has made it possible to live and to breathe.” I
                                asked if he had ever tried to overcome his addiction. He shrugged.
                                “I guess I should,” he said. “I know I should. But I’m not sure I
                                can, and it isn’t really necessary. I am lucky to live in a society
                                that has accepted the fact that drugs and addiction are part of
                                life.”</p><a class="tny-slot" data-smart-underline-link-always=""

                                <p class="descender">In 1974, after decades of authoritarian rule,
                                a left-leaning faction of the Portuguese military led a coup that
                                subsequently became known as the Carnation Revolution. Suddenly, a
                                closed society became a boisterous democracy, and Portugal began to
                                face enormous social, economic, and political challenges. As one of
                                its first acts, the new government granted independence to Angola,
                                Mozambique, and other colonies. Hundreds of thousands of Portuguese
                                citizens returned from abroad, adding to the social tumult. “We had
                                a tough regime for forty-eight years and we were a closed society,
                                and this was particularly true for young people,” Goulão said as we
                                sat in his airy Lisbon office. Pictures of foreign dignitaries
                                lined the walls. “We were completely isolated from other parts of
                                the world—the hippies in San Francisco, the students in France in
                                the sixties. Faint echoes reached our shores, but nothing really
                                sunk in.”</p>

                                <p>In the United States, as in many European countries, the
                                acceptability of drug use—and its consequences—had been debated
                                extensively. But in Portugal, Goulão said, “the issue was never
                                discussed.” As international drug traffickers discovered a new
                                market in Lisbon, they also realized that the Iberian Peninsula was
                                an ideal gateway to Europe. Portugal became a transit point for the
                                distribution of cocaine from South America, heroin from Spain, and
                                hashish and marijuana from Morocco and other African countries.
                                (That has not changed. Goulão’s institute estimates that
                                seventy-seven per cent of the drugs seized in Portugal are destined
                                for other countries.)</p>

                                <p>“It spread very fast,” Goulão said. “We had an extremely low
                                prevalence of drug use compared with other countries, but then all
                                at once the gap between occasional users and people with a problem
                                began to disappear.” By the nineteen-eighties, after the initial
                                years of openness and experimentation, the government panicked and
                                began running extremely harsh advertisements on television equating
                                drug use with madness, evil, and crime.</p>

                                <p>In those days, Goulão ran a clinic in the Algarve. “It was a
                                disaster,” he said. “Such widespread heroin abuse fuelled the
                                <small>AIDS</small> epidemic. It was difficult to find a single
                                family without a drug problem.”</p>

                                <p>Every effort to increase drug penalties, to add police officers,
                                or to build neighborhood consensus seemed to end in failure.
                                Prohibition and its enforcement appeared to intensify the harm they
                                were trying to address. (That was most obviously true with the
                                H.I.V. epidemic; H.I.V. spreads rapidly among people who share
                                dirty needles.) In addition, banning some addictive substances
                                while permitting and taxing others has proved difficult to defend,
                                particularly considering the relative impact of the substances
                                involved. There is no country where illegal drugs kill as many
                                people as legal addictive substances. The World Bank estimates that
                                tobacco will kill five hundred million of the present global
                                population.</p>

                                <p>It has been exactly fifty years since the United Nations adopted
                                the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the first truly
                                international effort to prohibit the growth, production, and sale
                                of narcotics, cannabis, and other illegal substances. Since 1961,
                                however, Western nations have struggled with rising rates of drug
                                abuse. Law-enforcement officials, politicians, and public-health
                                leaders have debated their alternatives frequently—and frequently
                                disagreed about what to do. That debate has never ended, and there
                                are still essentially two approaches to substance abuse:
                                rehabilitation and incarceration. In Portugal, though, a consensus
                                quickly formed, even among law-enforcement officials, that devoting
                                ever-increasing resources to drug interdiction had little or no
                                effect. And neither did relying on the criminal-justice system to
                                address the problem.</p>

                                <p>Eventually, the Portuguese government moved responsibility for
                                drug-control issues from the Justice Department to the Ministry of
                                Health. It was a striking decision; in other countries, drug abuse
                                has remained primarily a matter for law-enforcement agencies. In
                                the past forty years, American police officers have arrested
                                millions of nonviolent drug offenders, and hundreds of thousands
                                have been prosecuted. Rather than try to eliminate drug abuse,
                                Portugal’s approach, commonly known as “harm reduction,” attempts
                                to minimize the negative consequences for society. In recent years,
                                those consequences have become both more obvious and more
                                significant.</p><a class="tny-slot"

                                <p>“The prevailing approach in the rest of the world ignores
                                scientific reality and squanders resources on things that have been
                                shown again and again to fail,” said Miguel Vasconcelos, the chief
                                psychiatrist at the Taipas treatment center, the largest in Lisbon,
                                with eighteen hundred patients. When Vasconcelos began working at
                                the clinic, more than twenty years ago, there was no attempt at
                                harm reduction. “The goal was to get people off drugs,” he said.
                                “And for many patients that is still the goal. But there are people
                                for whom it is hard and some for whom it is not possible. This is
                                an alternative that does get people off the streets, reduces the
                                rates of H.I.V. infection, and lowers crime. It is humanistic but
                                also pragmatic.”</p>

                                <p>The relationship between crime and addiction has long been
                                clear. In the United States, more than seventy per cent of inmates
                                test positive for illicit drugs when they are arrested; substance
                                abuse is by far the most common reason for parole violations. The
                                attempt to support a habit frequently leads to criminal
                                behavior—drug sales, theft, prostitution. Vasconcelos pointed out
                                that punishment is not a deterrent: “The prisons are full, but that
                                has not helped lower the rate of drug abuse. Our law does not
                                permit drug use; that is important. Harm reduction is like a lure
                                in fishing. It is the thing we can do to talk to people and tell
                                them there is a way to stop.”</p><a class="tny-page"

                                <p>Statistics associated with drug abuse are not easy to parse.
                                Laws, approaches, and customs vary widely among countries, and they
                                change over the years. In the nineteen-eighties, the prevailing
                                trend in most of the world was toward harsher treatment of even
                                casual users. Today, policy officials in many countries are trying
                                to change that pattern, but there are many goals in the war on
                                drugs, and it is hard to choose the most meaningful among them. Is
                                drug use increasing? Has it become socially and economically
                                ruinous? What drugs are being used and by whom? How much violence
                                is associated with drug addiction? How old are those with the
                                biggest problem and why do they have that problem? Poverty is often
                                the answer to the last question, and in 1999, before Portugal
                                introduced the new regimen, the country had a high level of poverty
                                compared with other European nations, many heroin addicts, and a
                                serious problem with H.I.V. Thirty-seven per cent of injecting drug
                                users were receiving methadone to manage their addiction; ten years
                                later, that figure was sixty-seven per cent. The number of people
                                convicted of drug offenses fell from forty-four per cent of the
                                prison population, in 2000, to twenty-one per cent, in 2005; the
                                percentage of people using heroin in prison also fell sharply.</p>

                                <p>“I used to be the biggest believer in locking up the bad guys,”
                                João Figueira, the chief inspector of the Judicial Police crime
                                squad and its drug division in Lisbon, said. He told me that he was
                                unhappy when the law was introduced, and he struggled with it
                                morally. Within a year, he had changed his mind. “In the last years
                                before the law, consumers were arrested by police,” he continued.
                                “They were fingerprinted and made statements and took mug photos
                                and were presented to court. And always, always, always released.
                                It was a waste of everyone’s time. It didn’t stop drug use or slow
                                down the dealers. So the idea that somehow people are getting away
                                with what they did not get away with before is silly.”</p>

                                <p class="descender">Elisabete Moutinho, a clinical psychologist,
                                who works for one of the drug outreach programs funded by the
                                Ministry of Health, stood on a cobblestone plateau above the slope
                                that leads to what was once the center of Lisbon’s Casal Ventoso
                                neighborhood. She looked across a nearby highway at a housing
                                development of the type that often seems to rise along the ring
                                roads that circle the world’s capitals. It was utilitarian, and
                                utterly lacking in charm. “That must be a dull place to live,” I
                                said. She smiled and replied, “There are worse things than dull. In
                                this area, dull is an improvement.”</p>

                                <p>Twenty-five years ago, Casal Ventoso was essentially a giant
                                shooting gallery, and, every day, thousands of people would line up
                                to buy heroin, then they would fade into the dense warren of homes
                                and kiosks that covered a series of connected hills. Walking
                                through the squalid neighborhood meant weaving around piles of
                                used, often bloody needles and, on occasion, stepping over a dead
                                body. Casal Ventoso was a daily catalogue of human misery. In 1998,
                                the government brought in a fleet of bulldozers and razed the
                                neighborhood.</p><a class="tny-slot"

                                <p>Moutinho, who is thirty, is a charismatic and idealistic woman
                                with a demeanor that invites people to tell her their problems. “We
                                are not here to judge or scold,” she said. “This is purely a
                                public-health initiative. We want these people in the system,
                                unafraid, able to come to us if they are in need. And in turn we
                                test them for diseases, treat them when they are sick. This is a
                                better outcome for them than taking them to the hospital or the
                                morgue. And it is a better outcome for the people of this
                                country.”</p>

                                <p>She and her team had arrived in a station wagon filled with drug
                                paraphernalia: tinfoil, for people who smoke heroin rather than
                                shoot it (which is often the only way for longtime addicts to get
                                their fix, since years of injections have ruined their veins), and
                                stacks of clean syringes, sterile wipes, and other accessories
                                required to inject heroin safely. The exchange policy is simple:
                                bring in a used needle and get a new one. “There is no limit,”
                                Moutinho said, as a man approached clutching nine syringes in his
                                fist. She chatted with him as he deposited the needles, one by one,
                                into a container she had placed in the center of the platform. “How
                                is your arm?” she asked, noticing what appeared to be significant
                                ulcerations along the inner part of his left arm. He shrugged and
                                told her that he had been at the doctor’s office two days earlier;
                                in order to receive methadone, people must agree to periodic
                                checkups and blood tests. When the man had deposited the last of
                                his refuse, Moutinho counted out nine new pouches for fixing
                                heroin, along with nine syringes, and handed them over. He nodded
                                and moved on.</p>

                                <p>As people straggled up to the team, Moutinho explained, “We are
                                here the same time every day, and people can count on that.” I
                                asked if she had any qualms about aiding people in their quest to
                                satisfy addictions. “That is the wrong way to think about what we
                                do,” she said. “Of course, you can come here and still buy heroin.
                                The dealers know where we are and when we are here. People exchange
                                syringes and then go buy drugs.</p><a class="tny-page"

                                <p>“I know that is not easy for everyone to accept,” she continued.
                                “But they don’t get <small>AIDS</small> from a dirty needle, or
                                hepatitis. They are not beaten by gangs or arrested or put in jail.
                                There is no police corruption, because there is nothing to get rich
                                from. It is a program that reduces harm, and I don’t see a better
                                approach.”</p>

                                <p>Later that afternoon, in the Alcântara section of Lisbon, I
                                visited the Centro de Acolhimento, a short-term residency for drug
                                addicts who need a place to begin new lives. The building, near the
                                docks, is on both the seedy side of town and the cool side, and
                                could easily have been the headquarters of an adventurous
                                industrial designer. The floors—unbroken expanses of concrete—and
                                the soaring windows made the room feel accessible and spacious. A
                                few dozen people sat quietly eating at picnic-style tables arranged
                                in the middle of the room. Francisco Chaves, the psychologist who
                                has run the center since it opened, in 2009, admitted that he had
                                mixed feelings about Portugal’s approach to drug addiction. He is a
                                religious activist who believes in rehabilitation and moral
                                tenacity. To him, “harm reduction” offers little of that. “This law
                                takes away all pressure to stop using drugs,” he said. “Nobody
                                stops without pressure. That’s not the way humans are built. When
                                you promise methadone to anyone who wants it, you are going to get
                                people who say there is no reason to stop. This idea that everybody
                                has a right to take drugs is wrong. Morally, I don’t agree. I worry
                                because are we not simply creating a society that is completely
                                socially dependent?”</p>

                                <p>That view is echoed by Manuel Pinto Coelho, a physician who has
                                treated addicts for many years, and is the president of the
                                Association for a Drug Free Portugal. He has emerged as perhaps the
                                most vigorous Portuguese critic of decriminalization, and when we
                                met, in Lisbon, Pinto Coelho had just returned from Vienna, where,
                                before the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, he had spoken
                                passionately against easing drug penalties. “Medicalization of this
                                deviant behavior has provided powerful support to the idea of
                                expanding the concept of addiction as a disease,” he told me. “That
                                convinces most addicts that they have to remain dependent on
                                methadone rather than struggle to become independent. It is a
                                service neither to them nor to society.” He is particularly
                                offended by the notion that supporting human rights implies
                                supporting greater investment in harm reduction: “Is it really a
                                human right to remain in chemical chains?” Pinto Coelho argues that
                                the system has been tilted in favor of those who don’t even try to
                                quit. “I have treated many addicts in my life,” he said. “It is
                                very hard to quit, and some people fail. But many succeed, and
                                society should reward their success, not make a statement that the
                                effort is unnecessary. We shouldn’t be making life easier for
                                people who decide to use drugs—we should make it more
                                difficult.”</p>

                                <p class="descender">Richard Nixon declared a “war on drugs” in
                                1971. For the next fifteen years, though, instead of battles there
                                were mostly minor skirmishes. Then, in 1986, Ronald Reagan signed
                                National Security Directive 221, which turned the war into a
                                national-security priority. The reasons were clear: cocaine from
                                South America, where drug cartels fought openly, had displaced
                                Southeast Asian heroin as the major drug threat to the United
                                States, and violence associated with drug sales escalated rapidly.
                                Federal spending on drug control rose just as sharply, from $1.5
                                billion, in 1980, to $6.7 billion, in 1990. The number of arrests
                                for drug offenses nearly quadrupled, to more than four hundred
                                thousand per year.</p>

                                <p>According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, by
                                the mid-nineteen-nineties trafficking and sales of illegal drugs
                                had become a four-hundred-billion-dollar-a-year industry—ranking it
                                with the oil companies and the worldwide (and legal) arms trade. In
                                the United States, tough words on drugs became a required part of
                                any politician’s rhetoric. In 1996, President Bill Clinton named
                                Army General Barry McCaffrey as director of the Office of National
                                Drug Control Policy and increased its staff significantly. Later
                                that year, Clinton announced a new National Drug Control Strategy.
                                The first priority, according to the President, was “to get young
                                people to reject drugs.” The problem had become acute, and many
                                policymakers wanted to solve it no matter the cost.</p>

                                <p>By June, 1998, the sense of urgency had reached the United
                                Nations. That month, delegates gathered in New York for a special
                                session devoted to the world’s growing drug problem. The session
                                even had a slogan, “A Drug-Free World: We Can Do It.” The purpose
                                was to produce a plan that the international community could use to
                                fight, and win, the global war on drugs. The United States took the
                                lead in writing early drafts of the proposal, which called for a
                                complete end to illicit drug use by 2008. Later, after lobbying
                                from Latin-American delegates, who were more realistic, the wording
                                was amended to include the phrase “eliminating or significantly
                                reducing.”</p>

                                <p>Nobody questioned the severity of the crisis, but many
                                politicians, scientists, and criminal-justice officials doubted
                                that relying so heavily on law enforcement—and abolition—would
                                work. There was already strong evidence that drug addiction was a
                                biologically and psychologically complex illness—one far more
                                amenable to preventive efforts and medical care than to punishment.
                                On the first day of the special session, hundreds of the world’s
                                leading statesmen and political officials published an open letter
                                to Secretary-General Kofi Annan in the New York <em>Times</em>. The
                                signatories included former U.N. Secretary-General Javier Pérez de
                                Cuéllar, former Secretary of State George Shultz, Walter Cronkite,
                                former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, many Nobel Prize
                                winners, and elected officials from around the world. “We believe
                                that the global war on drugs is now causing more harm than drug
                                abuse itself,” the letter began, and pointed out that U.N.
                                conventions, focussed largely on crime and punishment, made it
                                difficult for countries to devise effective local solutions.
                                Despite increasingly harsh sanctions, the drug industry “has
                                empowered organized criminals, corrupted governments at all levels,
                                eroded internal security, stimulated violence, and distorted both
                                economic markets and moral values.”</p><a class="tny-page"
                                data-smart-underline-link-always=""

                                <p>The letter concluded by warning that “realistic proposals to
                                reduce drug-related crime, disease and death are abandoned in favor
                                of rhetorical proposals to create drug-free societies.”</p>

                                <p>The leadership at the United Nations ignored the message
                                completely. But conservatives, who objected to any shift from
                                punishment to rehabilitation, responded sharply. In the
                                <em>Times</em>, A. M. Rosenthal, the paper’s former executive
                                editor, praised the U.N. meeting and described harm reduction as
                                nothing more than the first step on the slippery slope to
                                legalization. Bill Clinton seemed to agree. In 1993, his Surgeon
                                General, Joycelyn Elders, had been quoted on the subject of
                                prosecuting drug users. “I do feel we would markedly reduce our
                                crime rate if drugs were legalized,” she said. “But I don’t know
                                all the ramifications of this. I do feel that we need to do some
                                studies.” Elders never advocated legalization or even the removal
                                of criminal sanctions; she wanted more research. The White House
                                had other ideas. “The President is firmly against legalizing
                                drugs,” Clinton’s press secretary said at the time. “And he is not
                                inclined in this case to even study the issue.” Attitudes under
                                George W. Bush were no different.</p><a class="tny-slot"

                                <p>“This is an extremely complex issue involving producers,
                                suppliers, distributors, local salespeople, and consumers, and we
                                are into absolute simplicity,” said Alan Leshner, the chief
                                executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement
                                of Science and a former director of the National Institute on Drug
                                Abuse. He added that Americans tend to see these issues in stark
                                terms; people are either for legalization or against it. “Those
                                kinds of positions help no one,” he said. “We need to use law
                                enforcement. But, if there is one thing about this issue I can
                                promise you, it is that we are not going to arrest ourselves out of
                                this problem.</p>

                                <p>“Yet we live in an ideologically fraught society,” he continued,
                                “a society that can pretend that drug use will go away if we just
                                fight hard enough, if we ‘just say no.’ What politician will vote
                                to reduce funds dedicated to the war on drugs?”</p>

                                <p>In the United States, the penalty for using a particular drug
                                has rarely had any relationship to its inherent danger. As Arthur
                                Benavie pointed out in “Drugs, America’s Holy War,” in 2009, the
                                American approach to illegal substances has as much to do with who
                                takes the drugs as it does with the drugs’ putative effects on
                                people or society. In the late nineteenth century, doctors often
                                prescribed opiates with abandon—“The typical opiate addict was a
                                chronically ailing middle- or upper-class woman who had been
                                addicted by her doctor,” Benavie wrote. Mary Tyrone, a character in
                                Eugene O’Neill’s “Long Day’s Journey Into Night,” believed to be
                                modelled on his mother, was that kind of addict. Most cocaine
                                addicts were doctors. Nobody talked about sending them to
                                prison.</p>

                                <p>By 1915, however, the demographics of addiction had changed and
                                so had American attitudes toward drug users. Cocaine had come to be
                                seen as a drug taken by lower-class, urban men, who were often
                                looked upon with fear and disdain. Opium had been tolerated in the
                                United States for more than a century—until Chinese laborers began
                                to compete with Americans for jobs. Since then, the more directly a
                                drug has been perceived to be associated with minorities and the
                                poor, the graver the danger it is seen as posing to society. Until
                                last year, when President Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act,
                                penalties for possessing or selling crack cocaine, used heavily by
                                minorities, were a hundred times more severe than those for powder
                                cocaine, a form of the drug often consumed by prosperous white
                                people.</p>

                                <p class="descender">“There has been, since the dawn of man, the
                                desire to get high,” Thomas McLellan, a longtime expert on
                                addiction, told me not long ago. “Some of the first crops raised by
                                humans were not meant to eat or to feed livestock. They were for
                                fermentation. To drink.” McLellan recently returned to academia
                                after serving for two years as the deputy director of the Office of
                                National Drug Control Policy. He has taught at the University of
                                Pennsylvania Medical School for thirty years and runs the Center
                                for Substance Abuse Solutions, in Philadelphia, which promotes
                                science-driven reform of substance-abuse policy. He had never
                                served in the government until he was appointed the
                                Administration’s leading spokesman on prevention and treatment
                                options. McLellan said that he wasn’t eager to accept the job, but
                                did so for personal reasons.</p>

                                <p>In 2008, a few months before he assumed his position, McLellan’s
                                youngest son, who was thirty, died of an overdose of anti-anxiety
                                medication mixed with alcohol. McLellan’s wife is a former cocaine
                                addict. “My entire family is in recovery,” he said. “I thought,
                                Maybe there’s a way where what I know plus what I feel could make a
                                difference.” Together with Gil Kerlikowske, the U.S. drug czar, who
                                is a former Seattle police chief, the Office of National Drug
                                Control Policy has attempted to shift the focus in the war on drugs
                                from combat to treatment.</p>

                                <p>Under Kerlikowske and McLellan, the Obama Administration has
                                placed a new emphasis on medical solutions to drug abuse. The
                                Affordable Care Act, passed last year, requires for the first time
                                that substance abuse be considered a chronic disease, like diabetes
                                or hypertension. Beginning in 2014, insurers may no longer deny
                                coverage based on known substance-abuse problems. “For
                                approximately twenty-three million Americans, substance use
                                progresses to the point that they require treatment,” McLellan told
                                Congress last year. “This is roughly the same number of American
                                adults who suffer from diabetes. In the U.S., the only disease that
                                affects more people is heart disease.” Yet currently available
                                medicine is rarely relied upon in drug programs. The Obama
                                Administration has pushed for wider adoption of treatments that
                                help manage withdrawal symptoms as well as those which reduce
                                cravings for drugs. The drug-control office has also initiated
                                programs that help health-care workers spot problems
                                early.</p><a class="tny-slot" data-smart-underline-link-always=""

                                <p>“I think for some folks radical change will be their only
                                measure of success,” Kerlikowske has said. “I don’t think we’ll see
                                that. I think we’ll make a lot of progress, we’ll slow the
                                freighter down and start turning it in the direction of the more
                                balanced view.” Federal health officials have estimated that every
                                dollar spent on substance-abuse treatment saves the United States
                                seven dollars that would be spent on prison, police, and courts. “I
                                understand the desire to wring somebody’s neck when you find out
                                they are using drugs,” McLellan told me. “If you imagine that
                                addiction is the willful act of an antisocial person who needs to
                                learn his lesson, you ought to lock him up. But we have tried that
                                and I don’t see many people learning their lesson.”</p>

                                <p>Nonetheless, McLellan does not favor a Portuguese approach for
                                the United States. “It’s not an ideology with me,” he said. “If you
                                make any attractive commodity available at lower cost, you will
                                have more users. Anything like legalizing drugs is preposterous—no
                                less ridiculous than trying to lock up every offender.” As
                                evidence, he points to the epidemic of prescription-drug abuse.
                                “These drugs are created, controlled, and distributed in the most
                                careful possible way,” he said. “It doesn’t prevent abuse.”</p>

                                <p>Many people argue that because nobody is forced to take drugs
                                the burden of addiction should not be borne by society. “It is true
                                that you don’t have to start,” McLellan said. “But once you do, and
                                once you become an addict, then a certain series of biological
                                changes take place and you are no longer able to simply stop.”
                                Nearly all addicts believe they can overcome their dependence
                                without help. The overwhelming majority do not succeed. Research
                                has shown that long-term drug abuse results in changes in the brain
                                that persist after a person stops taking drugs. Often, the first
                                time somebody abuses drugs, he experiences particularly intense
                                feelings of pleasure. The brain has activated circuits that make
                                him feel good, and that message is carried by the neurotransmitter
                                dopamine. As the brain starts to become used to those pleasures and
                                demand them, neurons, sensing a surplus, begin to make less
                                dopamine. The chemical begins to lose its ability to activate the
                                pleasure circuits. As that happens, people start to need drugs just
                                to bring dopamine levels back to normal. To feel good, or to get
                                high, requires more and more dopamine—which requires more and more
                                drugs.</p>

                                <p>“Addiction is a disease you have for which there is no cure, and
                                which fits the model of chronic illness,” McLellan said. “It will
                                be a problem for the rest of your life. So you don’t want a
                                thirty-day program. It won’t help. There are no thirty-day diabetes
                                programs or twelve-visit hypertension clinics. The name for that is
                                malpractice.</p>

                                <p>“Imagine we had an insurance program for diabetics along the
                                lines of the programs we have had for substance abuse,” he went on,
                                noting the American inclination to treat chronic diseases after
                                they have already caused irreparable harm. “Do you want to tell
                                people who ate too many doughnuts that the American health-care
                                system can’t accommodate their illnesses? It is nobody’s idea of
                                the best use of a forty-two-thousand-dollar cell to house a person
                                who has committed a minor crime or a parole violation associated
                                with drug abuse. We all know that. And we are a better country than
                                that.”</p>

                                <p class="descender">Nobody can say with certainty whether
                                Portugal’s decriminalization program is helping persuade people to
                                seek treatment, since those facilities became far more accessible
                                just as the new law was passed. There are also questions about
                                whether the benefits that Portugal has seen since 2001 reflect
                                evolving patterns in European life and not the success of its
                                program. Between 1998 and 2008, even though the number of addicts
                                in Portugal enrolled in treatment jumped by sixty-three per
                                cent—from twenty-three thousand to more than thirty-eight
                                thousand—that could have potentially happened, critics say, without
                                decriminalization or the expansion of clinics. “We know Portugal
                                decriminalized drugs,” said John Carnevale, a former director of
                                planning, budget, and research at the Office of National Drug
                                Control Policy under Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton. “But we
                                don’t know the effects of that decriminalization.”</p>

                                <p>People who favor policy reform say that Portugal’s experiment
                                shows, if nothing else, that decriminalization has permitted the
                                Portuguese criminal-justice system to focus on more significant
                                criminals and more dangerous crimes. But what works in a small
                                seaside nation in Southern Europe is not necessarily likely to work
                                in a place that is larger, richer, and more heavily plagued by drug
                                abuse. And, though about half of American adults believe that
                                marijuana use should be legalized, there has been no serious
                                discussion of making all drugs legal in the U.S.—or in any other
                                country. Still, if prison were no longer a common penalty, there
                                would clearly be more money available for treatment programs. And,
                                if the Portuguese pattern held true, there would be fewer crimes to
                                punish.</p><a class="tny-slot" data-smart-underline-link-always=""

                                <p>“It is never easy to draw a lesson from complex experience,”
                                Brendan Hughes, of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and
                                Drug Addiction, in Lisbon, said. “But here we are in Lisbon
                                thirteen years after the U.N. vowed to abolish illicit drugs in a
                                decade. Has anybody here seen a drug-free world?” he said, noting
                                that the annual United Nations World Drug Report usually runs to
                                about three hundred pages. During the ten years following the 1998
                                declaration, when eradication was supposed to have been
                                accomplished, the number of people using opiates throughout the
                                world grew by thirty-five per cent; the number of cocaine users
                                grew by nearly thirty per cent.</p><a class="tny-page"
                                data-smart-underline-link-always=""
                                data-smart-underline-link-background-position="69"

                                <p>Expenditures, particularly those associated with the criminal
                                prosecution of drug abusers, have also risen dramatically, as has
                                the size of the correctional system in the United States. Since the
                                late nineteen-eighties, most of that growth can be attributed
                                directly to drug abuse. The cost of running the state-prison
                                systems has grown by four hundred per cent, and it is expected to
                                grow even more rapidly in the next decade. According to the
                                National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, those costs
                                represent at least ten times the amount of money spent on
                                treatment, prevention, and research. In Portugal, where drug
                                control is funded in part by lottery receipts and money seized from
                                traffickers, the ratio is the opposite: more than ninety per cent
                                of costs are now devoted to treatment, not punishment.</p>

                                <p>Before I left his office, Hughes suggested that I take a close
                                look at the 2009 World Drug Report, in part because it was issued
                                by the same agency that, little more than a decade before, had
                                called for the worldwide elimination of drugs. It, too, expressed
                                the need for a radical reassessment of the war on drugs.</p>

                                <p>Perhaps the strongest case against the current system of drug
                                control has less to do with its costs, or even its effectiveness in
                                reducing the availability of drugs, than with the violence and
                                corruption associated with the black market. The prevailing
                                approach has had the perverse effect of enriching criminals who
                                kill and bribe their way from the countries where drugs are
                                produced to the countries where drugs are consumed.</p>

                                <p>It is common in the U.S. to judge drug addiction morally rather
                                than medically, and most policy flows from that approach. By now,
                                however, the data showing that the war on drugs has failed are not
                                in dispute; Obama Administration officials do not even use the
                                phrase. Yet one has only to look at the American health-care system
                                to be reminded that neither science nor evidence necessarily drives
                                public-policy decisions. More money, per capita, and a greater
                                percentage of income, is spent on health care in the United States
                                than in any other nation. Nevertheless, the U.S. lags behind most
                                of the rest of the Western world in health outcomes. If anything,
                                the war on drugs is more complex; while it is clear that a purely
                                punitive approach cannot succeed, it is far less obvious what
                                might. While it would make no sense to base American policy on a
                                decade-long Portuguese experiment, it seems even more foolish to
                                ignore results that call so clearly for an increased focus on
                                treatment, not jail time.</p>

                                <p>“You started by asking if I thought Portugal was on the right
                                track,” Hughes said. “That’s not really a question I feel competent
                                to answer. But if you look at enough of these reports, and study
                                the data behind them, you can’t help but feel that the country
                                can’t be on more of a wrong track than the rest of the world.”</p>

                                <p class="descender">Night had begun to fall at the underpass near
                                Lisbon’s Praça de Espanha metro station. Two methadone vans, which
                                cruise the city with the eerie regularity of ice-cream trucks,
                                pulled into a cul-de-sac under the motorway. People were starting
                                to gather for their daily doses. An outreach team arrives every day
                                at 6 <small>P</small>.<small>M</small>. and stays for an hour and a
                                half, and often another van appears, carrying a doctor who is
                                available to conduct checkups. “This is a strategic location,” one
                                of the physicians told me. “People need to take their methadone
                                every day, and this place is near the metro and just off the
                                roadway. If you are in a car, you can stop off without being
                                conspicuous. If you need to get here on the metro, we are easy to
                                find.”</p><a class="tny-slot" data-smart-underline-link-always=""

                                <p>This van serves about six hundred people a day, and the economic
                                status of the clients is not always easy to determine. Several
                                people drove up in Fiats, but a couple of Mercedes sedans were also
                                parked at the side of the road. A nurse sat with a laptop, a bottle
                                of methadone, and a few hundred Dixie cups. Each person presented
                                an I.D., and the nurse checked his or her dosage on a database,
                                then gave the person a cup and a bottle of spring water to wash it
                                down. Several cops walked by and smiled. The vans make five stops a
                                day between 8:30 <small>A</small>.<small>M</small>. and 7:30
                                <small>P</small>.<small>M</small>. Everyone does his business
                                briskly and walks away. There are no chats or knots of people who
                                hang around at the methadone truck after work. It was a ghostly
                                assembly, an effect no doubt enhanced by the failing light. You
                                don’t see a lot of smiles or laughter in lines like these. You
                                don’t sense a lot of promise, either. I told the doctor I was with
                                that the entire program seemed strangely methodical.</p>

                                <p>He laughed and replied, “Thank you. We like methodical. It is
                                better than frantic, or desperate, or dangerous. I admire these
                                people exactly because they are methodical. They are trying. Every
                                day, they get up and try. The main complaint about our approach, as
                                far as I can tell, is that they ought to try for something harder.
                                They all ought to stop using drugs.</p>

                                <p>“I think what’s hard is to acknowledge reality,” he continued.
                                “These people are living in the real world. If they are boring, or
                                live with narrowed vision or limited ambition, I am happy. I am
                                proud. Because I know what the other side looks like. It is ugly.
                                Perhaps it is a national failing, but I prefer moderate hope and
                                some likelihood of success to the dream of perfection and the
                                promise of failure.”&nbsp;<span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
